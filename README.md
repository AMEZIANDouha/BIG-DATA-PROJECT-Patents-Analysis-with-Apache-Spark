## 1. Project Overview

Our project involves the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of patent data from multiple sources, including Google Patents, USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office), ECPACENET, WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization), and FPO (Free Patents Online). The patent data is collected using a combination of Google patent scraper, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. 


The scraped data is then systematically organized and stored in a MongoDB data lake, allowing for efficient retrieval and management of complex patent documents and metadata.

The analysis phase utilizes Spark, a distributed computing framework, to process large volumes of data and uncover valuable insights into technological advancements and trends. Final data storage is managed using MongoDB Atlas, ensuring scalability and reliability. The insights and results are then visualized using Power BI and Tableau, providing interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports.

Furthermore, our project includes the development of a professional Graphical User Interface (GUI) using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask. This interface provides an enhanced user experience, facilitating interaction with the data and presenting results in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
